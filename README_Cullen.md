Project Manager and Point Man
Made sure that things could run as smoothly as they could and was also present for the team whenever they ran into any problems. I made sure that everyone had something to do.

I made the original files/folders for the main stuff: "css" folder with css for the 3 html pages, "img" folder, index.html, signin.html, and signup.html. Brought in some boilerplate code for the 3 html files.
I did all of the work for the signin.html. After that, I made a template for where things were supposed to go for the index.html so the team knew where things were supposed to go. I also tried to keep everyone interested in the project and was also there if anyone had questions or asked for something to do. Also cleaned up the UI after I got everything in.

The picture on SignUp does not work for me, but works for everybody else.
